ELMSLN
==============
ELMS Learning Network (ELMSLN) is an open source educational technology platform for building and sustaining innovation in course technologies. It accomplishes this by taking a Suite of Tools approach to learning design, allowing several systems to make up the different aspects of a course learning environment.  Each course effectively forms a network of technologies (hence the name) which can then be better tailored to each individual course's needs.

LICENSE
==============
ELMSLN is a collection of many, many projects, all individually licensed, all open source. The myriad of License files is why this section is added to avoid confusion. If you have a licensing question or concern please raise it in the issue queue.

- The ELMS:LN top level repository is GPLv3, though most of the underlying code pulled in is not GPLv3. V3 enabled the greatest level of compatibility with our downstream repositories
- Drupal core and contributed modules / themes are GPLv2 due to licensing requirements of the drupal.org community.
- GravCMS is MIT licensed
- Polymer core is BSD 3 clause
- The majority of included Webcomponents (especially those from the [LRNWebComponents](https://github.com/LRNWebComponents) repos) are Apache 2.0
